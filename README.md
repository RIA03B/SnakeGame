# SnakeGame

This game is a Snake Game. It is a simple game that you can interact with using the errows on your keyboard. The player controls a block, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (in our case a block is displayed as food), you can go through the walls as long as you want and will not be disqualified. Instead you keep  going and your score will be displayed based on how much food the snake can get.
